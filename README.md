Planning and meetings:

1. This game was primarily build from scratch with html and css used in the frontend part and Django used for the backend.

2. We were collaborating on  github for the first time. So we had initial struggle in using it but after sometime found it really amazing tool to collaborate.

3. Planned various offline and online meetings to plan up the things. Adjustments were made based on feedbacks.
